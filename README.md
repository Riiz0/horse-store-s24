## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`contracts/`**: Contains smart contract implementations in Solidity, Huff, and Yul.
- **`tests/`**: Hosts the test suite for validating contract functionality and performance.
- **`lib/`**: Includes utility libraries and dependencies essential for development and testing.

## Key Features

1. **ERC721 Implementation**: Fully compliant with the NFT standard for tracking horse ownership.
2. **State Management**: Efficient handling of horse attributes using mappings and arrays.
3. **Low-Level Optimization**: Incorporates Huff and Yul for reduced gas consumption.
4. **Differential Testing**: Comprehensive testing ensures functional parity across multiple implementations.
5. **Gas-Efficient Design**: Optimized contract design to minimize transaction costs.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: High-level language for Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Huff**: Assembly-like language for crafting gas-efficient contracts.
- **Yul**: Intermediate representation for low-level contract optimizations.
- **Foundry**: Framework for contract development, testing, and deployment.
- **Forge**: Testing suite integrated with Foundry.
- **EVM**: Ethereum Virtual Machine as the runtime environment.

## Implementation Details

The HorseStore V2 contract delivers the following functionalities:

### Core Functionalities

1. **Horse Management**
   - `mintHorse`: Mint a unique horse NFT with specific attributes.
   - `transferHorse`: Facilitate horse ownership transfers.

2. **Feeding Mechanism**
   - `feedHorse`: Update the feeding timestamp of a horse.
   - `isHappy`: Determine if a horse is well-fed within a set timeframe.

3. **ERC721 Compliance**
   - Adheres to all ERC721 standards for NFT functionality, including ownership and transfer operations.

### Gas Optimization Techniques

- **Bitwise Operations**: Compact and efficient storage of boolean flags.
- **Custom Errors**: Reduces the gas cost associated with `revert` messages.
- **Huff Optimizations**: Low-level implementation for precise control over opcodes.
- **State Variables**: Strategically organized for minimal storage costs.

## Testing Approach

Robust differential testing ensures that contract implementations behave consistently across all supported languages:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tests validate all key functionalities.
2. **Cross-Language Validation**: Solidity, Huff, and Yul implementations are tested for parity.
3. **Gas Usage Analysis**: Benchmarks gas consumption across implementations.

## Gas Optimization Techniques

Key techniques implemented to reduce gas costs include:

1. **Bitwise Storage**: Efficient handling of flags and attributes.
2. **Custom Reverts**: Replaced default revert messages with concise custom errors.
3. **Optimized Loops**: Streamlined iterations to minimize unnecessary operations.
4. **Low-Level Constructs**: Leveraged Huff and Yul for precise and efficient computation.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, the following skills and concepts are demonstrated:

- Mastery of **low-level programming** in Huff and Yul.
- Proficiency in **differential testing** to ensure implementation consistency.
- Deep understanding of **EVM internals**, including stack, memory, and storage management.
- Expertise in **gas optimization** for cost-efficient contract deployment.
- Thorough understanding of the **ERC721 standard** for NFTs.
